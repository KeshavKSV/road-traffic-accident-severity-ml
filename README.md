Problem Statement: The goal of this project is to predict the severity of road traffic accidents using machine learning classification algorithms. The target variable, "Accident_severity," is a multi-class variable indicating different levels of accident severity. The objective is to create a predictive model that accurately classifies accident severity and assess the model's performance using the F1-score metric.

Description: The dataset for this project was collected from the Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments for a master's research work. It covers road traffic accidents recorded between 2017 and 2020. The dataset, containing 32 features and 12,316 accident instances, has been carefully curated to exclude sensitive information. The primary objective is to preprocess and analyze the data to identify the major causes of accidents using various machine learning classification algorithms.
